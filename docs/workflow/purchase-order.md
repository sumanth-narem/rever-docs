options for creating or importing POs:

### PO Creation Options

**Option 1**: Create PO Manually 

-  Go to **Expenses → Purchase Orders → PO List page →** click **Create PO**.
-  You can either:
    - **Click “Extract PDF”** : Upload a PDF of the PO and let the system extract
       key details (vendor, item description, quantity, price).
    - **Create Manually** : Enter all PO details directly in the form (Vendor, Items,
       Quantity, Unit Price, Delivery Date, Payment Terms).
-  Review the extracted or entered data.
-  Click **Save** button where the File will be moved from Draft to Under review Stage
    of the PO.

Use **Extract PDF** when you want Rever to pre-fill fields from a PO document. Use
**Upload PO** for bulk imports or multiple PDFs.
