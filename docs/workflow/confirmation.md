# Confirmation

Goods confirmation is an essential step in the **3 - Way Matching** process and helps
ensure that the goods received match the Purchase Order (PO) and the invoice. This
feature is **enabled only when 3-Way Matching is turned on** under **Settings > Controls**.


How Goods Confirmation Works  
**Enable 3-Way Matching**  
Go to **Settings â†’ Controls** and activate the **3 - Way Matching** option. This will allow
members to request goods confirmation.

**Assigning Goods Confirmation**
From the **Matching Screen** , members can assign a Lite User to confirm whether the
goods mentioned in the bill have been received.

**Lite User Page**
The Lite User receives tasks in their dashboard, which is divided into two main tabs:


- Open Tasks - Shows all pending goods confirmation requests.
  - These tasks require the Lite User to review the bill details and
confirm whether the goods have been received.
- Closed Tasks - Shows tasks that are either completed or revoked.
  - **Confirmed**: The Lite User successfully confirmed goods receipt.
  - **Revoked**: The task was either reassigned to another Lite User or
automatically closed because the bill moved to the next stage of
approval without confirmation.

Revoke Status Details **:**
The **Revoked** status helps members track tasks that were not confirmed by the Lite User. This ensures visibility on which bills proceeded to approval without goods
confirmation.
