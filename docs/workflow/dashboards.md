# Dashboards

Rever provides **three powerful dashboards** that give users real-time visibility into their
Accounts Payable process. These dashboards are interactive, analytics-driven, and
allow users to drill down into specific bill data directly from the dashboard view.


Rever offers the following dashboards:

- **Summary** – Always available for all users.
- **2 - Way Matching** – Visible when 2-Way Matching is enabled in **Settings →**
    **Controls**.
- **3 - Way Matching** – Visible when 3-Way Matching is enabled in **Settings →**
    **Controls**.

Users can switch between dashboards from the top navigation menu.

dashboard is automatically activated and displayed.

Common Features Across All Dashboards

- **Interactive Filters:** Date, amount, vendor, and status filters apply instantly.
- **On-Page Drill-Down:** Clicking a card reveals the detailed bill list within the same
    page - no need to navigate away.
- **Search & Export:**
    o Search bills by vendor, invoice number, or amount.
    o Export filtered results to CSV for offline analysis.
- **Role-Based Data Visibility:** Admins see all bills; members and approvers see
    only those they have permission to view.
