### Before you begin

 - [Create a Rever account](https://app.reverfin.ai)

**Steps to Get Started**

To begin, you will first sign up and access Rever through the web portal using Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. After clicking Sign Up, you can register with your corporate email address by providing the required details. A verification email will be sent, and once confirmed, your account will be activated.

- Visit the Rever Web Portal (Website) using a supported browser
(Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
- Click Sign Up and register using your corporate email address by
providing the required minimal details.
- Verify your email to activate your account.

2. **Configure Company Profile**
Once your account is active, the next step is to configure your company profile. This is done by navigating to Settings → General Settings, where you can enter essential details such as your company’s email address, phone number, preferred date format, business type, and industry. You will also be prompted to provide a complete address, including the country, state, city, and ZIP code.

number, preferred date format, business type, and industry.
- Store Company Address: Record the complete address details,
including country, state, city, and ZIP code.


3. **Add or Sync Chart of Accounts**
After the company profile is set up, you will need to add or sync your chart of accounts. Rever offers two options: manual entry or integration with QuickBooks. With manual entry, you can directly create account groups such as Assets, Liabilities, and Expenses. If you prefer automation, you can connect Rever to your QuickBooks account (admin credentials required) and enable continuous synchronization for real-time updates.

- Option 1: Manual Entry – Add your chart of accounts directly in Rever by
creating account groups (Assets, Liabilities, Expenses, etc.).
- Option 2: QuickBooks Integration –
▪ Connect Rever to your QuickBooks account (requires QuickBooks
Admin credentials).
▪ Enabled continuous sync for live updates.

4. **Invite Users & Assign Roles**

Next, you can invite users and assign roles by going to Settings → User Management. Here, you can add users by entering their email addresses and assigning them roles such as Member, Lite User, Finance Manager, or System Admin. Each role comes with specific permissions, ensuring users only access invoices, approvals, and payments relevant to their responsibilities.

- Navigate to Settings → Members.
- Invite users by entering their email addresses.
- Assign appropriate roles such as Member, Lite User, Finance Manager,
System Admin.
- Configure role-specific permissions to control access to invoices,
approvals, and payments.

5. **Set Up Approval Workflows** 
Finally, you should set up approval workflows by navigating to Settings → Approvals. Rever allows you to configure multi-level approval hierarchies (L1–L5), which can be applied to both purchase orders (POs) and bills. This ensures that transactions follow a structured review process before being finalized.

- Navigate to Approval Settings: Go to Settings → Approvals and
configure multi-level approval hierarchies (L1–L5).
- Apply Approvals: These approval levels can be defined for both
Purchase Orders (POs) and Bills.
